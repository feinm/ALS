## Chapter 3: Analyze Purpose and Audience

- ### Key Questions
  - What is the overall purpose of the communication?  Is this change-oriented or informative?
  - What would be a good one-liner to explain the objective?
  - What is the format for communications?  How much time?
  - What is the time and place for this?  *Consider if it's a Friday after 1600; everyone probably wants to go home*
  - Who will read or hear this?
  - What is the educational background of your audience?
  - Do you need to provide any details prior to engaging with the audience?
  - Are you trusted?
  - Is the audience motivated for the topic?
  - Is coordination required prior?
  - Are you making promises?

- ### What Is My Purpose?
  - Think about the *what* and *why*
  - **Direct** - Describe actions you want to be carried out
  - **Inform** - Simply passing on information
  - **Persuade** - Influence a new idea, policy, product, or change
  - **Inspire** - Sending a personal message to lift up the audience

- ### Drafting a Purpose Statement
  - **Purpose Statement** - A singular sentence that captures the objective; also known as *BLUF* (Bottom Line Up Front)

- ### Audience Analysis: The Human Factor
  - **Know Yourself** - Be aware of personal strengths / weaknesses
  - **Know Your Organization**
  - **Know Your Audience**
    - Primary receiveer is the person you directly communicate with
