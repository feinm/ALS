## 5 Steps of Critical Thinking
- ### Step 1: Adopt the Atitude of a Critical Thinker
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Open-mindedness
    - Healthy skepticism
    - Intellectual humility
    - Free thinking
    - High motivation
  - Seek out the facts to support our views and evaluate many sides
  - Not everything is *black and white* and information received should be handled appropriately
  - *Get creative* with your thinking
  - Having curiosity to explore different viewpoints and topics are crucial
- ### Step 2:  Recognize & Avoid Critical Thinking Hinderances
  - Basic Human Limitations - We aren't perfect and within a specific issue, sometimes getting an adequate understanding of the issue is all we can do rather than think we will be the "know all" of everything.
  - Use of Language - Understanding when words are used to communicate thought and behavior, rather than ideas or feelings.  Basically, what and how we say things matter!
  - Faulty Logic or Perception - Numbers and logic can be used to manipulate others.
  - Psychological and Socialogical Pitfalls - Just like with logic, the influences from others can be twisted to gain power and influence.
- ### Step 3:  Identify & Characterize Arguments
  - **Argument** - Presentation of a reason to support a conclusion (Argument = Reason + Conclusion)
    - Reasons = *premises, evidence, data, propositions, proofs, and verification*
    - Conclusions = *claims, actions, verdicts, propositions, and opinions*
    - You must have at least one, if not more *Reasons* and *Conclusions* to each *Argument*
    - **Deductive Arguments** - When *B* is inferred from *A*
    - **Inductive Arguments** - Based on *reasonable grounds* for conclusions; not *black and white*
- ### Step 4:  Evaluate Information Sources
  - Look for information sources that are *credible, unbiased, and accurate*
  - **Questions**:
    - Qualifications to make claim?
    - Reputation for accuracy?
    - Motive for inaccuracy?  Biased?
    - Reasons to question integrity?
- ### Step 5:  Evaluate Arguments
  - **Assumptions** - Reasons implied in an argument that are taken for granted to be true
    - **Warranted** - ***NOT SPECIFIED IN TEXT; UNFINISHED***
    - **Unwarranted** - If it doesn't meet *either of the warranted criteria*
  - **Reasoning** - Assessing the *relevance* (QUALITY) and *sufficiency* (QUANTITY) of the *evidence*
    - Reasonable doubt can be used as a guideline for sufficiency
  - **Omissions** - Determining if important evidence has been omitted or suppressed
 
| Hindrance | Definition | Example | Critical Thinking Tip |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Confirmation Bias & Selective Thinking | The process whereby one tends to notice and look for what confirms one's beliefs, and to ignore, not look for, or undervalue the relevance of what contradicts one's beliefs. | If one believes that more murders occur during a full moon, then one will tend to take notice of murders that occur during a full moon and tend not to take notice of murders that occur at other times. | Obtain and objectively evaluate all relevant information and sides of an issue before passing judgment. |
| False Memories & Confabulation | Being unaware that our memories are often "manufactured" to fill in the gaps in our recollection, or that some memories of facts, over time, can be unconsciously replaced with fantasy. | Police officers should not show a photo of a possible assailant to a witness prior to a police lineup, or the actual memory of the witness may be unconsciously replaced. | Put more reliance on proven facts than memory recollection or testimonies from others. | Know your own memory limitations. |
| Ignorance | The lack of essential background knowledge or information on a subject prior to making a judgment. | One may be convinced a "yogi" has the power to levitate objects, but does not see the thin wire attached to them. | Perform appropriate research on multiple sides of issues to obtain all pertinent evidence, before reaching conclusions. |
| Perception Limitations | Being unaware of our own perception limitations that can lead to misconceptions about reality. | Looking up at the stars at night and perceiving they are as close as the moon and planets. | Recognize that "seeing is not always believing" because of our sensory limitations. Know when & how to verify your observations with other sources. |
| Personal Biases & Prejudices | We each have personal biases and prejudices, resulting from our own unique life experiences and worldview, which make it difficult to remain objective and think critically. | Some people are biased against claims made by scientists because their worldview appears too cold and impersonal. | Resist your own biases by focusing on the facts, their sources, and the reasoning in support of arguments. |
| Physical & Emotional Hindrances | Stress, fatigue, drugs, and related hindrances can severely affect our ability to think clearly and critically. | Air traffic controllers often have difficulty making good judgments after long hours on duty | Restrain from making critical decisions when extremely exhausted or stressed. |
| Testimonial Evidence | Relying on the testimonies and vivid anecdotes of others to substantiate one's own beliefs, even though testimonies are inherently subjective, inaccurate, unreliable, biased, and occasionally fraudulent. | Dramatic stories of Bigfoot sightings do not prove the existence of Bigfoot. | Resist making judgments based on testimonies alone. | Extraordinary claims generally require extraordinary evidence. |
